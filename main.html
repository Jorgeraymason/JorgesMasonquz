    <h1>
        Welcome To The Quiz Page!
    </h1>

    <h2> 
        What's going on? Just answer the questions accordingly and honestly and you will do good. 
        This is just a series of random questions, they are in no specific order, once again just anwser them. 
        The buttons do not change color on click, but they do record your input.
        Last thing, if you do decide to get into coding, then I challenge you to make a far better quiz site then this one.
